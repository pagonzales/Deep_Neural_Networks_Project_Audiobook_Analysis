# Deep Neural Network Project (Classification Problem: Analysis of Audiobook customers)
## Problem
The input data represent 2 years worth of engagement. From a given database of an Audiobook app, each customer has purchased at least once. We want to create a machine learning algorithm that can predict if a customer will buy again from the audiobook company. The main idea is that the company shouldn't spend its advertising budget targeting individuals who are unlikely to come back.

## Project Objective
To create a machine learning algorithm using deep neural networks to predict if a customer will likely to buy again or not.

## Data used
- <a href = "https://github.com/pagonzales/Deep_Neural_Networks_Project_Audiobook_Analysis/blob/main/Audiobooks_data.csv">Dataset</a>

## Metrics
- Which are the most important metrics for a customer to come back.
  - Does the customer leave a review or now?
  - What is the rating of the review?
  
## Action plan
- Preprocess the data
  - Balance the datasheet
  - Divide the dataset into train, validation, and test data
  - Save the data into a tensor friendly format
- Create the Machine Learning Algorithm
- Finally, Test the model using the test data
